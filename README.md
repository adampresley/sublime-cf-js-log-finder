# Sublime ColdFusion console/CFDUMP/CFABORT Finder

## About
Sublime ColdFusion console/CFDUMP/CFABORT Finder is a Sublime Text 2 plugin designed to allow
users an easy way to find code in ColdFusion and JavaScript source that may
contain commands like *console.log()*, *&lt;cfdump&gt;*, or *&lt;cfabort&gt;*.


## Installation
To "install" this plugin find your User Packages directory for Sublime. In Windows 7
this would be something to the effect of **C:\Users\me\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 2\Packages\User**.
For most \*nix distributions that would be **/home/me/.conf/Sublime Text 2/Packages/User**.

Download the project and place the *sublime-cf-js-log-finder* directory into the above packages directory. 
This will load up the plugin. It also will create menus, context menus, and a key binding. 

Once complete you should be able to open a JavaScript or ColdFusion file and execute it one of the 
following ways:

* CTRL + ALT + K
* Right-click -> Adam Presley -> Find console/CFDUMP/CFABORT
* Tools -> Adam Presley -> Find console/CFDUMP/CFABORT
